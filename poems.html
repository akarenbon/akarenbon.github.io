  Stuff I Write

  Hey. What's up? I'm Belinda. <br> I'm just some high school student who knows really basic coding. This year, I'm going to be a senior in high school. <br> I like doing a lot of things, learning a lot of thingss, daydreaming about a lot of things. <br> Generally, I like writing.
</h3>

<h3 style = "color:crimson;" align = "center"> I like writing poetry and short stories. Most of them are depressing. <br> It's hard to write something nice. <br> I joined my school's Writer's Club when I was a freshman because I wanted extra credit but eventually, I began to like it.

    <th>Willow Red
      <h5 style = "color:brown;"><pre style="font-family:timesnewroman;" align="center">
        In a certain city with a name long forgotten,
        Down a dreary road with a sidewalk long rotten,
        Over there sits a hospital they call Willow Red
        Where the bodies are breathing but the people are dead.

        Within, she had a child. She was told it would kill her.
        They cherished the life and called her a killer.
        She birthed the child and died in the act.
        The baby followed after, in two hours, exact.

        And so Mary died along with her lamb.
        But such things are the norm in the home of the damned.

        The surgeon, his hands, had touched many hearts.
        He loved that his own would hunger such parts.
        He ate and he ate ‘til he could stuff no more.
        Despite the hearts eaten, a heartless carnivore.

        And so Judas continued for years, months and days,
        Yet he remains in the hospital as none there ever prays.

        The inseparable twins named Abel and Cain,
        Their hands held together throughout all the pain.
        But one wanted freedom, to let go of the other.
        And so Cain betrayed and severed his brother.

        Both siblings passed in their hospital room.
        Of course, at this place, they all meet their doom.

        The windows are stained with a color too rusty.
        The walls chip down slowly as their dull eyes grow dusty.
        You can strive to live and then you can die.
        You cannot be both in one instance or try.

        But at this old hospital named Willow Red,
        The bodies are breathing and the people are dead.

  <th>If and Then
    <h5 style = "color:brown;"><pre style="font-family:timesnewroman;" align = "center";>
        If love be a drop of water
        Then I drown in a sea of lies.
        Sugar-coated honeycombs
        Block out my bitter cries.

        If hope be a shining star
        Then my home is in the city.
        A stray dies in the alley,
        Arousing no one’s pity.

        If joy be a warm embrace
        Then my hands are the coldest ice.
        I have played the gambler’s game;
        I have rolled the worst of dice.

        If death be a horde of flies
        Then my corpse is rotting much.
        A leaf falls down gracefully,
        Missing the tree’s loving touch.
        </pre></h5></th>

  <th>Dear Faustus
    <h5 style = "color:brown;"><pre style="font-family:timesnewroman;" align = "center";>
      Dear Faustus, you poor old soul.
      Your insatiable hunger for the powerful role.
      You bested the best and gained knowledge of all,
      But at the end of your time into Hell did you fall.
      The ink of the contract drawn straight from the vein,
      The blood that clotted to make you refrain.
      Many chances you had to return to God’s favor
      As the Devil kept dreaming of your soul’s sweet flavor,
      And yet you refused the forgivens that were continuously given,
      Opting to stray from the goals you had originally driven.
      Wonders you’d do were forgotten in fame.
      Messing with others, your name put to shame.
      No better than a fool that used magic for trash,
      You stooped to a low-life who did dog tricks for cash.
      And on that dark night, the night you would die,
      You cried out to God, giving one last try.
      It’s too late for you, Faustus. You had your chances.
      The demons surround, pulling you into their dances.
      I watched as you burned, as you screamed for my hand.
      I can help you no more for the deal does not stand.
      You had only one soul, Faustus, and much time to repent,
      All of it wasted and so frivolously spent.
      Oh Faustus, dear noble, ensnared by sin’s treats,
      Your eternal damnation for cheap tricks and some feats,
      There are others like you lured in by such bliss.
      You are not alone.
      Sincerely, Mephistopheles.

        Chang’e slaughtered the white rabbit
        And dyed the moon a lucky color.
        I have done something out of habit,
        A mistake made like no other.

        That your heart wants to scream but never ever shows.

      <h5 style = "color:brown;"><pre style="font-family:timesnewroman;" align = "center";>
        To cackle in the face of kings and mock their thrones of corpses,
        As creatures that have never died know it best, so remorseless.
